<h3>How to install and run</h3>
<p> First, you must install the programs. Now you have to clone the project and used this commands.</p>
<p>To clone, use:</p>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduappdevs/eduapp
cd eduapp/backend/eduapp_db
gem install bundle
bundle install
```

<p>After using these commands, you need to look inside the config folder and find the database.yml. There, you must change the database password and put your postgreSQL password, otherwise, the database will not work.</p>

<p>To have elegible data in the database, enter the following commands:</p>

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate:reset // Used to restart all database values
```

<p>After you have followed these steps, you can start the server with:</p>

```bash
rails s
```

<p>To stop the server you have to use CTRL + C.</p>

<h1>Use Cases</h1>
<img src="./Documentation/UseCases.jpg" />

<h1>Usability</h1>
<p>We have used orange and blue as principal colors , then we use a different gray scales and white.</p>
<p>After an intensive search we have found the perfect combination with orange and blue as principal colors, combined with a bolder font weight.</p>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/colorsExample.png'>
<p>In the sign up form , we have added a advisor in the passwords fields , which gives you feedback if the password it's empty or the confirmation password does not match with the previously written password.</p>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/signUpForm.png'>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/signUpForm2.png'>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/signUpForm3.png'>
<p>Before the password its written and the confirmation password matches , you aren't able to sign up the account and the submit button were disabled , after the confirmation matches it will be enabled and you can submit and sign up the account.</p>
<p>This is the function which checks if the password it is empty or the confirmation password matches with the previously password field.</p>

```bash
  checkPasswordMatch = () => {
    //Check first password field is not empty
    if (this.state.password.length > 0) {
      this.setState({
        passwordEmpty: false,
      });
      if (this.state.password === this.state.password_confirmation) {
        this.setState({
          passwordMatches: true,
        });
        document
          .getElementById("registration__submit")
          .removeAttribute("disabled");
      } else {
        this.setState({
          passwordMatches: false,
        });
        document
          .getElementById("registration__submit")
          .setAttribute("disabled", true);
      }
    } else {
      this.setState({
        passwordEmpty: true,
      });
    }
    //Check if password_confirmation matches
  };
```
<h2>This app has implemented a full responsiveness, with individual development for mobile and desktop</h2>
<p>In desktop , this is how it looks sign up form:</p>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/signUpFormDesktop.png'>
<h2>Mobile view</h2>
<p>Here you can see how the navbar looks , with icon buttons in the bottom of the page becouse it is more easier to users.</p>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/mobilePreview.png'>
<p>We have decided to change the styles of the navbar buttons, choosing a transparent background, the buttons have a default blue background if you are not in that location, if you click in that button this will change to orange to give you feedback about where you are. </p>
<h3 align="center">Before/After</h3>
<div align="center">
<img height='400' src="./Documentation/PrototypeScreenshots/prototypeMobile.png"/>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/mobilePreview.png'>
</div>
<h2>Desktop view</h2> 
<p>Here you can see how the navbar looks, placed at the top of the page, the reason why we have decided to change that is becouse in a desktop environment it is more common to see the navbar at the top and text in the buttons instead of icons.</p>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/desktopPreview.png'>
<h2>Eduapp have a dark mode</h2>
<p>The reason why we have decided to implement a dark mode it is becouse in the last time it is very common to see in all the apps.</p>
<p>A dark mode gives you a comfortable experience in situation where the light it is dark, otherwise you force your eyes to see the screen, although this were uncomfortable.</p>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/darkModeBefore.png'>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/darkModeAfter.png'>
<p>Then the page looks like this</p>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/darkModeResources.png'>

<h2>Loading animation</h2>
<p>When page were loading , an animation will be on screen.</p>
<p>This it's a frame of it , this hole animation was created in pure css.</p>
<p>This gives you feedback when something is loading.</p>
<img height='400' src='./Documentation/Usability/loadingAnimationFrame.png'>

<h1>Tech stack and comparison</h1>
<p>In our case , currently we are developing EduApp as a web app , using a full responsiveness , but we like to make it downloadable , 
making eduapp as a hybrid app.</p>
<div >        
     <a href="https://reactjs.org">
            <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB" alt="React"/></a>
   </div>
     
We are using react js as frontend framework , react provides us many advantages , such an easier learning, reusable components, ReactJS is choosing by most developers, becouse it provide us a very rich JavaScript library
<div>
    <a href="https://rubyonrails.org">
        <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/rails-%23CC0000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=ruby-on-rails&logoColor=white" alt="Rails"/></a>
   </div>
At backend we have decide to use Ruby on rails , which provide us a Model View Controller architecture , a fast development when you know the basics of it , 
a great number of helpful tools and libraries , also it haves many disadvantages , like the price of a mistake , you have to pay attention to all the small details ,otherwise your ruby on rails journey will becomes difficult.

<h1>Docker Mounting</h1>

Mounting to docker is easy, but we need to make some adjustment to Ruby on Rails first.  
To start off, you must clone the branch called "docker-config" which has been previously prepared for straight docker composing.
Before mounting to docker, please look into each ```Dockerfile``` and modify your environment variables to your need.

Once configured environment variables, run ```docker-compose up -d``` inside the root directory to mount and start the database, backend api, frontend interface and administration panel once the mounting completes.  
If you wish to mount only the backend, frontend, or administration panel, make sure you position yourself inside the corresponding directory and run the command above, to mount only the corresponding docker-compose.  

Once finished mounting, you must access the API container shell and run the following command to create and migrate the database:  

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate:reset
``` 

And you will have successfully mounted and deployed EduApp to multiple docker containers!

<h1 id="personal-opinion-and-comparison">Personal opinion and conclusions</h1>
<p>It is a pleasure to us be part of this project , as our first project working in with other people,becoming this project a challenge , we found many difficults in the journey, but we also have learned so much through it,although this it is just the beggining of the project and so much things will happen through the journey.</p>
